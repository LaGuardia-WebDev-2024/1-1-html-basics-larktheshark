    Lyrics
  </h3>
  <p>
    I don't want to hurt you, <br>
    
No reason have I but fear <br>
    
And I ain't guilty <br>
Of the crimes you accuse me of <br>
But I'm guilty of fear <br>
I'm sorry to remind you <br>
But I'm scared of what we're creating <br>
This life ain't fair <br>
You don't get something for nothing, turn now <br>
Mmm, gotta try a little harder <br>
It could be sweet <br>
Like a long forgotten dream <br>
  </p>
